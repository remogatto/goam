This file contains descriptions of defined constants that can be used
in a GOAM configuration file.

Values of some of these constants can be changed via command-line flags.
The change can be used to determine the behavior of GOAM.conf files
on a different operating system, on a different CPU architecture, etc.


const GOOS string = runtime.GOOS

    The name of the operating system. The default value is equivalent
    to 'runtime.GOOS' as defined by the Go runtime.

    The "-conf-os" flag can be used to freely change the value of this
    constant. Note that this only affects the code within GOAM.conf files,
    it does NOT actually change the operating system nor the compilers used.


const GOARCH string = runtime.GOARCH

    The name of the CPU architecture. The default value is equivalent
    to 'runtime.GOARCH' as defined by the Go runtime.

    The "-conf-arch" flag can be used to freely change the value of this
    constant. Note that this only affects the code within GOAM.conf files,
    it does NOT actually change the CPU architecture nor the compilers used.


const GO_COMPILER string

    The name of the Go compiler used to compile Go files.
    The value is one of: 5g 6g 8g gccgo.

    The value depends on the actual CPU architecture
    and on the "-gcc" command-line flag.
