Usage: goam [OPTIONS] make

Description:
  Builds all targets of the project, except tests and benchmarks.
  The list of build targets (libraries and executables) can be viewed
  by running "goam info".

  If a target requires an external package and GOAM fails to find
  the package locally, it will try to download the project providing
  the package and install it. The URL from which to download such an
  external package and the method of installation should be specified
  in the top-level "GOAM.conf" configuration file.

  All successfully installed external packages are reported to the Go
  dashboard, unless this feature is turned off.

Command chain:
  goam make <-- goam install-deps
